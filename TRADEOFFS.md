# Should I use this library?

## Pros ##

  - It is perfectly suited for validating REST requests and building single-page applications
  - Form definition can easily be serialized as JSON for client-side validation and form rendering with JavaScript
  - Small code footprint and very fast
  - Easy to write unit tests for
  - Part of the [Symlex](https://symlex.org/) framework stack for agile Web development

## Cons ##

  - While you can get [commercial support](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/contact/), 
    this library is not backed by a major company and has a small community
  - Does not render any HTML by itself (you can use any template engine and iterate over the fields though)
  - Don't use it if you are not comfortable reading at least small amounts of library code (you're welcome to ask for 
    help via email or send additional docs as pull request)
